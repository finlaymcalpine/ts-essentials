Notebooks on essential time series concepts, tools, and applications.

These notebooks form the early drafts of a series I plan to write on time series analysis. I struggled with understanding time series when I first encountered the topic, and I think there are concepts that I wanted to learn in more detail. I'm trying to approach this with the most straightforward approach possible: the aim is to make something that an early practitioner or student of the topic might find useful in learning concepts and when (or rather when NOT) to apply them.
