Notebooks on essential time series concepts, tools, and applications.

These notebooks form the (VERY) early drafts of a series I plan to write on time series analysis. I struggled with understanding time series when I first encountered the topic, and there were concepts that I wish had been covered in a different way. I'm trying to approach this with the most straightforward approach possible: the aim is to make something that an early practitioner or student of the topic might find useful in learning concepts and when (or rather when NOT) to apply them.

Any comments on content or style are appreciated. I'd especially like to hear what others wish they had covered in their early exposure to the subject of time series analysis.
