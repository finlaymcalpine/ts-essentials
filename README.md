Notebooks on essential time series concepts, tools, and applications.

These notebooks form the (VERY) early drafts of a series I plan to write on time series analysis. I'm trying to approach this with the most straightforward approach possible: the aim is to make something that an early practitioner or student of the topic might find useful in learning concepts and when (or rather when NOT) to apply them.

The level of this content is intended to be technical without rigour: I don't plan to include a great number of equations, but do intend to cover some of the more technical aspects of time series analysis. In any case, I think time series is an already advanced part of statistics and econometrics so it is natural that any coverage of the topic will not be truly entry-level.

Any comments on content or style are appreciated. I'd especially like to hear what others wish they had covered in their early exposure to the subject of time series analysis.
